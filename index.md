      I am an intensivist, anesthesiologist, and outcomes researcher. My work spans ICU operations and capacity planning, frailty and perioperative outcomes research, procedural ergonomics, and applied methods for observational data. I build pragmatic tools for measurement and risk adjustment and design training programs for point-of-care ultrasound and airway management.
