## 👋 Introduction

I am an anesthesiologist, critical care physician, and clinical epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. My work spans critical care operations leadership, perioperative outcomes research, procedural innovation, and medical education.

Outside the hospital, I make bean-to-bar chocolate, bike everywhere, and spend an unreasonable amount of time repairing our very old (1908) house—accumulating far too many tools along the way. I am also a recovering skier.

## 🏥 Clinical & Operational Leadership

I currently serve as a **Director of the Ellison 14 Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit** at MGH, where I lead clinical operations, quality improvement initiatives, and strategic development for a high-acuity, 10-bed multispecialty ICU.  

Since assuming leadership in 2020, our team—**Jenn Albert, Sue Algeri, and I**—have transformed a previously underutilized 7-bed Burn ICU (<20% occupancy) into a modern, fully staffed unit with **sustained 100% occupancy** and expanded surgical and critical care services.

## 🎓 Research Focus

My academic path began as a **Fulbright Scholar** in 2008, studying epidemiology and biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health. Today, my research focuses on:

- Measurement and impact of **frailty** in surgical patients  
- **Procedural epidemiology** and variation in care  
- **Perioperative** and long-term surgical outcomes  
- Improving outcomes of **complex, high-risk surgery** 
- **Observational methods**, risk modeling, and data-driven decision support  
- Innovation in **point-of-care ultrasound** and procedural ergonomics  

I have authored **45+ peer-reviewed publications**, contributed to major clinical handbooks, and presented at national and international conferences across surgery, anesthesia, and critical care.

## 🛠️ Clinical & Procedural Expertise

I am recognized nationally for expertise in:

- **Ultrasound-guided vascular access**  
- **Airway management**  
- **Critical care medicine**  
- Anesthesia for neurosurgery, orthopedics, GI, and complex surgical care  

At MGH, I have developed and refined new approaches to vascular access, including needle-tip optimization methods, improved image acquisition strategies, and ergonomic techniques now used across multiple departments. I also design and teach hands-on training programs for residents, fellows, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and practicing clinicians.

My device innovation work includes an ergonomic accessory for ultrasound-guided access that improves operator control, procedural safety, and infection control.
