# Projects

Below is a selection of major research projects as of December 2025. My current work is self-funded, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration. Please feel free to reach out. At this time, I do not have openings for research assistants or coordinators.

## Technical Research Expertise

**High (expert-level):**  
Administrative data (HCUP-NIS, HCUP-SID), logistic regression, ICD-10 coding, SAS programming, use of large language models for coding and editing

**Moderate (working proficiency, including unrefreshed past expertise):**  
Python, SQL, ML models, generalized estimating equations (GEEs), mixed models, SEER-Medicare data, R programming

**Aspirational / Actively learning:**  
Snowflake for Epic data, reinforcement learning (RL)

## Classification of Frailty in Surgical Patients
**Role:** Principal Investigator  
**Status:** In analysis and manuscript development

This project focuses on identifying limitations in current frailty models used in administrative datasets and developing **validated, robust frailty classification systems**. The goal is to create risk-adjustment tools that enable more accurate assessment of frailty’s impact on surgical outcomes across state and national patient cohorts and improve hospital quality comparisons.

Key methods and data sources include:
- National and state administrative datasets (HCUP-NIS, HCUP-SID, Medicare)
- Statistical modeling, internal validation, and sensitivity analyses
- Machine learning approaches for variable selection and classification

## Impact of Frailty on In-Hospital Outcomes of Major Thoracic Surgery  
**Role:** Principal Investigator  
**Status:** Paper 1 in second-round review at *Journal of Geriatric Oncology*; additional analyses planned

This research examines how frailty influences in-hospital outcomes among patients with lung cancer undergoing major thoracic surgery. Much of the prior literature is dated and limited by small cohorts, heterogeneous populations, and methodological shortcomings. Our work addresses these gaps using contemporary, representative datasets and improved outcome classification.

Innovations include:
- National administrative dataset (HCUP-NIS, 2016–2022)  
- A data-driven complication classification system  
- Planned analyses of differential outcome effects stratified by extent of lung resection

## Impact of Surgical Urgency on In-Hospital Mortality  
**Role:** Principal Investigator  
**Status:** Paper in second-round review at *Anesthesiology*

A recent study (Anesthesiology, July 2025) highlighted that the majority of perioperative mortality is associated with **non-elective** procedures. While the finding is correct, the downstream recommendation—prioritizing urgency over procedural type for resource allocation—oversimplifies clinical reality.

This project contextualizes those findings by demonstrating that **urgency alone does not fully characterize perioperative risk**. For example, a non-elective laparoscopic appendectomy is not comparable to an emergent aortic root replacement for acute dissection. Our work clarifies how urgency interacts with procedure type, acuity, and case complexity, providing a more nuanced framework for perioperative risk prediction and resource planning.

## ICU Utilization Trends for Non-Cardiac Surgical Patients Over Time  
**Role:** Principal Investigator  
**Status:** In analysis

Clinicians working in surgical ICUs have long observed a shift in case mix: fewer routine post-operative admissions and more admissions from the wards, ED, and outside hospital transfers. However, these trends have not been systematically quantified.

This project characterizes:
- Temporal changes in surgical ICU utilization  
- Increasing patient acuity and evolving admission sources  
- The changing landscape of postoperative critical care  

The goal is to provide empirical evidence for what many clinicians experience daily and to inform planning for ICU staffing, bed allocation, and capacity management.

## Device Design: Improving the Ergonomics of Handheld Ultrasound Probes (2020–2023)  
**Role:** Principal Investigator  
**Status:** Not active at this time  
**Sponsor:** MGH Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine Innovation Grants  
**Funding:** $6,000 (2021); $10,000 (2022)

This project involved the design and early testing of an ergonomic accessory to improve stability, needle alignment, and infection control during ultrasound-guided vascular access. The device aimed to reduce operator strain, improve image acquisition, and support consistent needle tip visibility—common challenges in both central and peripheral access procedures.

Although the project is not currently active, it laid the foundation for ongoing interests in procedural ergonomics and device innovation.
